(Note that pins 20, 21, 50 51 and 52 are hard-wired to the microcontroller's
internal hardware for those interfaces, and cannot be changed, unless you want to bit-bang
the SPI and I2C.)

Although it is designed to be used with an Arduino Mega, some pins (The DS18B20, the LDRs and
the XBee module) can be tested with the board plugged into an Arduino Duemilanove.

The accelerometer self-test should be used with caution since it is plugged
straight into the microcontroller and the accelerometer is a 3.3V device.
Perhaps PWMing it would be appropriate - I should have added a capacitor on
this pin on the board to smooth off the PWM.
